🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate MERN Stack Developer who believes in building things the right way — with clean code, thoughtful design, and seamless user experiences. I'm detail-oriented (perhaps obsessively so 😅), which means I'll spend hours perfecting a button's shadow until it feels just right.

🔭 Currently working on Full Stack Web Applications
🌱 Learning Advanced React Patterns & System Design
👯 Looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects
💬 Ask me about MERN Stack, DSA, or Web Development
⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving mathematical puzzles and algorithmic challenges
